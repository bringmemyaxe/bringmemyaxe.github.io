      <p>Dreams come true, but beware what you seek,<br>
      For they may haunt you, make you weak.<br>
      Afraid to act, afraid to stay still,<br>
      A paradox, a never-ending uphill.</p>
      <p>A crowd of problems, a system to fight,<br>
      Against me, they stand, with all their might.<br>
      Death, the greatest enemy, I strive to delay,<br>
      But life's cruel joke, it'll come anyway.</p>
      <p>In this chaotic storm, I seek a guiding hand,<br>
      A lighthouse to lead me to a safer land.<br>
      Questions unspoken, answers unknown,<br>
      A journey through darkness, I walk alone.</p>
      <p>Yet, in this vast sea of uncertainty,<br>
      I long to find a moment of clarity.<br>
      A beacon of hope, a ray of light,<br>
      To guide me through this eternal night.</p>
